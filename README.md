# SaversSearch

## Pitch/Idea

In this app users will be able to Login, then after logging in and getting access to the site the user will be greeted with a search bar.
The user can then search for anything they want to find the best deal on. The search will then return items from Amazon and Walmart comparing the
prices and show the user the best price.


## MVP

* User Login/Register
* Searchbar and display data
* Filter prices low to high

## Future Features

* Save items to your profile wishlist
* Search more then Amazon, Walmart
* Add Friends list that you can then share items with them
